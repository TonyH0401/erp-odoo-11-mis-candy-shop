Chapter 1: Business Functions and Business Processes
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): software used to coordinate info in business areas
	Manage companywide business process
	Use common database and shared reporting tools
Business process: takes input and creates output that is value to customers (quy trình hoạt đông của 1 doanh nghiệp, khác với business function là chức năng của doanh nghiệp)

Functional Areas and Business Process:
Understand ERP = understand business work = functional areas of operation + business processes

Functional area of operation (các phòng chức năng eg: phòng tài chính, phòng đào tạo,...):
	Marketing and Sales (M/S)
	Supply Chain management (SCM)
	Accounting and Finance (A/F)
	Human Resources (HR)
	-> Business functions: activities specific to a functional area of operation (hoạt động/chức năng của 1 phòng ban cụ thể)
	Xem slide 17, hình minh họa

	Functional areas are interdependent (độc lập nhưng nối kết), requires data from others
	Better integration of functional areas leads to improve communication, workflow and success 
	Information system: computer, people, procedures, and software that store, orgnaize and deliver information

Business Processes (quy trình làm việc của 1 doanh nghiệp)
	Khác business function là có input và output, xem xét khách hàng trong các giao dịch, từng người liên quan trong quá trình đó phải tham gia dù không trong fucntional area
	Luôn xem xét dưới góc độ của khách hàng, phải thỏa mãn nhu cầu khách hàng
	Xem slide 20, hình minh họa việc mua 1 smartphone
	
	Customer is not required to interact with EACH business function when involved the process (khách hàng không cần tương tác với từng functional areas trong quá trình mua hàng)
	Xem slide 23, hình minh họa quy trình mua hàng của khách hàng phải là 1 chiều nhưng quy trình của doanh nghiệp là nhiều chiều
	Effective sharing info -> efficient business process
	Intergrated info systems: vùng thông tin chung nơi các phòng ban (functional areas) share thông tin
	Inputs materials, people and equipment, outputs are goods and services
	Require an up-to-date system to be efficient
	
	Study case coffee shop, làm 1 cái bảng giống slide 20

Marketing and Sales (M/S):
	Functions:
		develop products and pricing
		promote the products
		taking customer orders
		help create a sales forecast (dự báo sale)
	Marketing and sales for a coffee shop:
		formal recordkeeping not required
		need to keep track of customers
		product development can be done informally
		Allow customers to charge credit card when purchase (records must show customers' owes and available credit)

Suply Chain Management (SCM):
	Function within:
		Making the coffee (manufacuturing/production)
		Buying raw materials (purchasing)
	Product planning require sales forecast from M/S functional area:
		Salse forecasts: analyses that attempt to predict the future sales of a product
	Production plans is used to develop requirements for raw materials and packaging:
		raw materials: water, fresh lemons, raw sugar,....
		packaging: cups, straw, napkins
	Also SCM and M/S must choose the recipe for each coffee product

Accounting and Finanace (A/F):
	Function within: record RAW data of transaction (including sales), raw materials purchases, payroll and receipt of cash from customers
	Raw data: number of collected from sales, manufacturing and other operations with any manipulation, calculation or arrangement
	Data from A/F is used by M/S and SCM:
		important to sales forecast -> staff decisions and product planning
		monitor to used for credit granting policy (cơ chế phần thưởng)

Human Resources (HR):
	Function: recuit, train, evaluate and compenstate (những việc cơ bản của HR)
	Uses sales forecasts of individual departments to plan personnel need
	Using ERP provides data sharing necessary between functional areas

Functional Area Infomation Systems (this is the business process):
	Inputs and Outputs for each functional areas area described (potentionally)
	Note the kinds of data needed and how people use it
	Maintain relationships between functional areas and processes

Marketing and Sales (M/C):
	Need information from other functional areas
	Customers communicate orders to M/S (via person, telephone, web,...)
	M/S has a role in determining product prices based on unit cost + percentage markup, require data from A/F and SCM.
	Xem slide 35, hình minh họa cho M/S
	M/S needs to interact with HR to exchange info on hiring needs, legal requirements
	Input for M/S:
		customer data
		order data
		sales trend data
		per-unit cost
		company travel expense policy
	Output for M/S:

chương 1 quan trọng là bussiness function và bussiness process
Chapter 2: The development of ERP systems

Important if the comapany wants to be competitive
ERP helps integrate company's operations:
	acts as company-wide computing ENVIRONMENT
	include shared database
	can deliver consistent data across all areas in real time

The evolution of information systems:
Silos:
	Info system configuration used recently
	Company had unintergrated info that supported individual functional areas
Current ERP system evoled as a result of:
	Advancement of hardware and software
	Development integrated info system (đây là hệ thống nội bộ của 1 tổ chức, giúp nâng cao khả năng truyền tin real time)
	Shift from function areas focus (chức năng phòng ban) to business process focus (quy trình kinh doanh)

Computer Hardware and Software (xem các năm):
	1960s and 1970s computer hardware and software developed rapidly
	1960s, 1st practical business computer were mainframe
	Over time, computers got faster, smaller and cheaper
	Moore's Law (it is a dead law now): number of transisters on a chip could double every 18 months
	Xem slide 62, minh họa về moore's law
	Advacement in computer software start at 1970s:
		1970s: relational database developed, provide business to store, retrieve and analyze large volumes of data
		1980s: spreadsheet software became popular, managers can perform complex business

Early attemps to share resources (xem các năm):
	Mid-1980s, telecommunications develops allow users to share data and peripherals (thiết bị ngoại vi) on local network
	- Client-server architecture
	The end of 1980s, hardware needed to support development of ERP system was in place
	Mid-1980s, database management system (DBMS) required to manage complex ERP software existed
	
The manufacturing Roots of ERP:
	Manufacturing software developed in 1960s and 1970s:
		Evoled from simple inventory-tracking system to material requirements planning (MRP) software
	Electronic data interchange (EDI):
		Direct computer-to-computer exchange of standard business documents (computer directly)
		Companies can handle the purchasing process electronically

Management's Impetus (thúc đẩy) to adopt ERP:
	Late 1980s hard economic + early 1990s cause company to downsize and reorganize -> stimulus ERP development
	Inefficient caused by funcitonal model of business organization:
		Silos of info (ông nào bik phần của ổng, còn những cái không quan tâm)
		Limits the exchange of info between operating levels
	Xem slide 67, hình minh họa cho product flow, tất cả đều dồn lên top management và không có sự kết nối giữa các functional areas
	Functional model led to top-heavy and overstaffed (thiết kế phân tầng, phân cấp) incapable of quickyly change:
	Process business model: info flows between operating levels without top level's involment
	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 further impetus for adopting ERP system, require companies to substantiate internal controls in all information
	Xem slide 69, hình minh họa cho ERP system between operating levels

ERP software emerges: SAP and R/3
	1972: 5 former IBM system analysts in Mannheim, Germany form Systems Analysis and Program Development - SAP (Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung)
	SAP's goals:
		could be configure to meets the needs of each company
		data available in real time
		working on computer screen rather than printed outputs
	
SAP begins developing software modules:
	During working at German chemical company ICI, Platter and Hopp developed the idead of modular software
	Software modules: individual programs that can be purchased, installed and run separately, but can extract data from common database
	1982: SAP realeased its R/2 mainframe ERP package
	1980s: sales grew rapidly; SAP extended its capabilities and expanded into international markets
	By 1988, SAP had exstablished subsidiaries in numberous foreign countries

SAP R/3:
	1988: SAP began develop R/3 to take advantage of client-server technology
	1992: first version of SAP R/3 released
	SAP R/3 system was desinged using an open architecture
	Open architecture: third-party software companies encouraged to develop add-on software products that can be integrated with existing software
	
New Directions in ERP:
	Late 1990s: Year 2000 (Y2K) problem motivated companies to move to ERP
	By 2000, SAP AG had 22,000 employees in 50 countries and 10 million users at 30,000 installations
	By 2000, SAP's competition in the ERP market:
		Oracle
		PeopleSoft
	Late 2004: Oracle suceeded in its bid to take over PeopleSoft
	PeopleSoft:
		founded by David Duffield, former IBM employee
		today, it's under Oracle, popular choice for managing HR and financial activities at universities
	Oracle:
		SAP's biggest competitor
		began in 1977 as Software Development Laboratories (SDL)
		founders: Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, Ed Oates
	SAP ERP:
		Lastest versions of ERP system by SAP and other allow:
			all business areas to access the same database
			elimination of redundant data and cummunication lags
			data entered once and used throughout the organization
	Current SAP ERP system: SAP Enterprise Central Component (ECC) 6.0 (có 11 phân hệ - modules)
		Sales and Distribution (SD) module
		Materials Management (MM) module
		Production Planning (PP) module
		Quality Management (QM) module
		Plant Maintenance (PM) module
		Assest Management (AM) module
		Human Resources (HR) module
		Project System (PS) module
		Financial Accounting (FI) module
		Controlling (CO) module
		Workflow (WF) module
	Xem slide 77 và 80, hình minh họa

SAP ERP software implementation:
	Not all companies that use SAP, use all SAP ERP module
	Data intergration is highest when companies use 1 vendor to supply its modules (ONLY 1 VENDOR)
	Configuration options allow customize modules to fit company's needs
	Tolerance groups:
		specific ranges define transaction limits
		SAP defined tolerance group methodology as its method for placing limits on employees
		configuration allows further tailor tolerance group methodology
	Feature of SAP ERP:
		first software that could deliver real-time ERP integration
		usability by large companies
		high cost
		automation of data updates
		applicability of best practices
			best practices: SAP's designers choose the best and most efficient ways business processes should be handled

ERP for Midsized comapnies:
	Application hosting:
		third-party provides hardware and software support
		makes ERP system like SAP more appealing to midsized companies
	SAP and Oracle are facing competition form smaller providers of ERP software

Responses of the software to changing market:
	Mid-1990s, companies complained about difficulty of implementing SAP R/3 system
	SAP responded by developing Accelerated SAP (ASAP) implementation methodology
		eases the implementation process
	SAP continues to extend capabilities of SAP ERP with additional, separate products that run on separate hardware and extract data from the SAP ERP system

Choosing Consultants and Vendors:
	One person can not understand the whole system
	Before choosing vendor: study their needs, hire external software consultants to help choose and the best approach to implementing ERP

The Significance and Benefits of ERP:
	More effiect business process that cost less
	Easier global integration
	Integrates people and date while eliminating updating and repairing separate computer systems
	Allows management to amnage operations, not just monitor them
	Dramatically reduce costs and improve operational efficiency

Question about ERP:
	How much ERP system cost:
		Depend on the size of the company it serves = size of the ERP
		Need new hardware capable of running complex ERP
		Consultants and Analysts fees
		Causes disruption when implement (this cost money as well)
		Training cost time and money
	Should every business buy an ERP package:
		Some business operations and segments might not be a good match for ERP's constraint
		Sometimes, company is not ready for ERP
		Management doesn't fully understand its curent business processes and cannot make implementation in a timely manner
	Is ERP software inflexible:
		Many claimed that ERP or SAP ERP are rigid
		Customization offered by SAP ERP:
			numberous configuration options
			can code specific routines using ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming)
		ERP system is in place, trying to reconfigure while retaining data integrity is expensive and time-consuming
	What return can a company expect from its ERP investment:
		Eliminates redundant efforts and duplicated data, saving operations expense
		ERP system produce goods and services more quickly
		Can be forced out of business by company that have ERP system
		Smoothly running ERP can save company's personnel, suppliers, distriutors and customer frestration
		Cost savings and increased revenue (difficult to put an exact number)
		ERP implementations take time:
			other factors make affecting costs and profitability
			difficult to isolate the impact of ERP system
		ERP provide real time data, improve external customer communication
	How long does it take to see a return on an ERP Invesment:
		Return on invesment (ROI): assessment of an investment project's value
			calculated by dividing the value of the project's benefits by the project's cost (lấy tiền lời chia tiền đầu tư)
		ERP's ROI can be difficult to calculate
		Peerstone Research study:
			63% reported positive ROI for ERP
			most felt nonfinancial goals were the reason behind their ERP installations
	Why do some companies have more success with ERP than others:
		Rollout and low ROI are caused by people and misguided expectations NOT COMPUTER MALFUNCTIONS:
			executives blindly hoping software will cure fundamental business problems (that are not curable)
			executive and IT managers not take enough time to proper analysis during planning and implementation phase
			executive and IT amnagers skimming employee education and training
			not placing ownership or accountability for the implementation project on the personnel who will operate the system
			large project such as ERP installation must promoted from the top down or it is doomed to fail
			bring tremendous change for users
		It takes users years before they can take advantage of ERP capabilities
		Most ERP installations do generate returns

The continuing evolution of ERP:
	Understand social and business implications of new technologies is not easy
	Since mid-1990s, ERP system have been in common use (meaning ERP is recent)
	ERP vendors are working to solve adaptability problems that plauge customers

Chapter 3: Marketing Information Systems and the Sales Order Process

Fitter Snacker (FS) this is a study case, giả sử:
	Fictitious company that makes healthy snack bar and do not have intergrated system
	M/S is the focal point of FS's activities
	FS's M/S area not intergrated well with other information system
		company-wide use of transaction data is inefficient
	Manufactures and sell two types under the Filter Snacker brand:
		NRG-A: advanced energy
		NRG-B body building proteins
	Has organized sales into groups (AKA divisions), these differ in quantities and pricing:
		Wholesale division (bán sỉ)
		Direct Sales divisions (bán trực tiếp, bán lẻ)
	Some store-brand wrappers for some chain stores

Problem with FS's Sales Process:
	Four common problem:
		incorrect pricing
		excesstive calls to the customer for info
		dalays in processing orders
		missed delivery dates		
	Reasons for these problems:
		FS has seperate information systems for 3 functional areas:
			Sales order system
			Warehouse system
			Accounting system
		High number transaction handled manually
		Info stored in 3 systems is not available in real time
	Xem slide 113, hình ảnh minh họa quy trình sale của công ty giả tưởng FS

Sales Quotations (báo giá bán hàng) and Orders:
	Give price quotation and then take customer's order at FS:
		Sales call: use saleperson to call or visit customer
		At the end of the call, saleperson generates two copies:
			Original goes to customer
			Middle copy fax and mailed to sales office
			Saleperson keep bottom copy in records
		Quotation form has 800 number that the customer can call to place an order
	Problem can occur with this hand to hand process	
	Inefficencies in the rest of the ordering process: delivery date, credit status, enter customer order into current order entry system

Order Filling:
	Packing lists and shipping labels: printed 2x/day, hand-carried, hand-sorted into orders
	Warehouse: small-order and large-order areas
	FS uses a PC database program to manage inventory levels in the warehouse
	FS keep inventory low and levels changed rapidly during the day:
		Pickers choose but there aren't enough goods
		To determine what to do, pickers chat with the warehouse supervisor

Accounting and invoicing:
	Invoicing customer is problematic
	Sales clerks send Account dept data of customer invoices
	Accounting dept loads data into PC-based accounting program
	Clerks manually make adjustments
	Order corrections are delayed and don't catch up to invoice process (late or inaccurate invoices)

Payment and Resturns:
	Prodems with procedure for processing payments:
		any errors, customer will receive invoice (annoying)
		customers don't return a copy of the invoice -> errors can resutl
	FS's returns process is flawed:
		do not call return marchandise authorization (RMA) or fail to include -> difficult for accounting dept to credit the account
		poor penmanship create problems for accounting
	Not properly credited -> receive a dunning letter in error

Sales and Distribution in ERP:
	ERP systems can minimize data entry errors and provide accurate info real time to ALL USERS
	ERP can track all transactions (invoices, packing lists, RMA numbers and pyaments)
	SAP ERP Salses and Distribution module treats the process as a cycle of events:
		Pre-sales activities
		Sales order processing
		Inventory sourcing
		Delivery
		Billing
		Payment

Pre-sales activities:
	Customers get pricing info about products (through inquiry or price quotation)
	Marketing activities: sales calls, visits and mailings
	Maintain customers data and generate mailing list based on customer characteristic

Sales Order Processing, series of activities much take place to record a sales order:
	Can start from a quotation or inquiry generated in the pre-sales step
	Info from customer to support quotation is included in sales order
	Critical steps:
		recording the items to be purchased
		determining the selling price
		record the order quantities
	Users can define various pricing alternatives in SAP ERP
	SAP ERP checks Account Receivable table to confirm customer's available credit
	If has sufficient credit -> order is completed
	If does not has sufficient credit -> prompt sales personnel to take appropriate actions

Inventory Sourcing:
	Available-to-Promise (ATP) check, SAP ERP check inventory records and product planning to:
		request material is available
		request material can be delivered on the desired date
		Include expected shipping time
	System can recommend an increase if a shortfall is expected

Delivery, releasing documents that warehouse uses to pick, pack and ship orders:
	Allows deliveries to be created so warehouse and shipping activites are carried out effiently
	Once documents for pick, pack and shipping created, they area transferred to Material Management module (MM)

Billing:
	SAP ERP create invoice by copying sales order into invoice document
	Accounting can print and mail this document to customers
	Accounting records are updated

Payment:
	SAP ERP automatically process payment by customers (debit and credit customer account)
	Timely record transaction has effect on the timeless and accuracy of credit check for the customer


A Standard Order in SAP ERP:
	Make FS system sales order more accurate and efficient
	ERP allows business process to cut across functional area lines

Taking an Order in SAP ERP
	Order entry screen in SAP ERP's 4.7 Enterprise system

	Customer master data, remain fairly stable, maintained in central database and available to all SAP ERP
	Material master data
	Organizational structures:
		define group customers and salespeople
		distribution channel

	SAP ERP assigns document number to sales order transaction, onced it is saved
	SAP ERP keeps track of the document number, employee can track order status when it is in process or research it after shipping
	Document flow in SAP ERP: linked set of document numbers related to an order
	Xem slide 141, hình minh họa cho sales order documents

Discount Pricing in SAP ERP:
	ERP can configure numbers of pricing strategies -> various discount allowed
	System safeguard can enfore limits on size of discounts

Chapter 4: Production and Supply Chain Management Information Systems

Production Overview:
	To meet customer demand, FS must:
		develop a forecast
		develop production schedule
	ERP is good tool for developing and executing production plans
	Goal of production planning is schedule prodcution economically
	Three general approaches to production:
		Make-to-stock items: anticipate order (cứ fill stock)
		Make-to-order items:  fill specific orders (nhận order thì làm)
		Assemble to order items: make-to-stock + make-to-order
	Some other approaches, về search xem chúng là gì:
		Order-to-cash
		Purchase-to-pay

FS's Manufactoring process:
	FS uses make-to-stock production (xem slide 166, hình ảnh minh họa)
	Can produce 200 bars/minute, 12.000/hour
	Each bar is 4 ounces
	48.000 ounces/hour
	Entire production line operates on one shift a day
	FS's production sequence

FS' Production problem:
	FS has problems deciding how many bars to make and when to make
	Communication problems:
		FS's M/S do not share with Production perosnnel
		Prodcution peronnel find it hard to sudden increases in demand (might cause shortage)
	Inventory problems:
		Production manager lacks systematic method:
			Meeting anticipated sales demand
			Adjusting production on reflect actual sales
	Accounting and purchasing problems:
		Standard costs: normal cost of manufacturing a product
		Production and Accounting must compare standard cost with actual costs then adjust

Production Planning Process:
	3 important principles for production planning (nguyên tắc quan trọng):
		work from sales forecasts and current inventory to create an aggregate production plan
		break down aggregation plan into more specific production plans for individual products and smaller time intervals
		use production plan to determine raw material requirements

SAP ERP Approach to Production Planning, xem slide 171, hình mình họa
	Sale forecast -> Sales & Operation planning -> Demand management -> purchase (nhập hàng về để sản xuất) ; production (sản xuất hàng để bán)

	Cost of sold: giá vốn hàng bán
	Sale: revenue

	Sale - Cost = gross profit - expense = profit before tax - CIT (tax) = profit after tax (net profit)

Sales Forecasting:
	SAP ERP take integrated approach:
		whenever a sale is recorded in SD module, quantity sold is recorded as a consumption value for that material
	Simple forecasting technique:
		use prior period's sales and adjust those figure for current conditions
	To make a forecast for FS:
		use previous year data + marketing initiatives
	Xem slide 173, hình minh họa

Sales and Operatings Planning:
	Sales and operation planning (SOP):
		input: sales forecast provided by MS
		output: production plan designed to balance market demand and production capacity (production plan is the input to the next step, demand management)
	Xem slide 175, hình minh họa

	SAP ERP, sales forecast can be made using:
		historical sales data from SD module
		input from plans developed in Controlling module
	CO module:
		profit goals can be set
		sales levels need to meet profit goal can be estimated
	
	Rough-cut planning: common term in manufacturing for aggregate planning
		disaggregated to generate detailed production schedules
	SAP ERP generated forecast, planner can view graphically result
	Rough-cut capacity planning applies simple capacity-estimating techniques to the production plan to see if the techiniques are feasible
	Xem slide 178, 179, hình minh họa
	
	History sales allow planner to correct sales values
	Do not account for external factors, such as unusual weather
	Sales figure forecasting represent best estimate of demand
	Xem slide 181-183, hình minh họa
	
	Disaggregating SOP:
		SOP is developed for product group
		SAP ERP allows any number of products to be assigned to a product group
		SOP disaggregated: production plan quantities specified for the group are transferred to the individual products that make up the group
	Xem slide 185 và 186, hình minh họa

Demand Management:
	Links the SOP process detailed scheduling and materials requirements
	Outputs: master production schedule (MPS), production plan for all finished goods
	For FS, MPS is an input to detailed shcediling, determines what and when to make
	Xem slide 189, hình minh họa

Materials Requirements Planning (MRP):
	Determines quantity and timing of production or purchase of subassemblies and raw materials needed to support MPS
	Bill of Material (BOM): list of the materials (including quanitties) needed to make a product
	Xem slide 190 và 191, hình minh họa

	Lead times (thời gian cần để xử lý đơn hàng) and lot sizing:
		Lead time: cumulative time required for supplier to receive and process the order, take the material out of stock, package it, load it on a truck and deliver it to the manufactorer
		Lot sizing: determining production quantities and order quantities
	MRP record: standard way of viewing the MRP process on paper
	Xem slide 193, hình minh họa
	
Materials Requirements Planning (MRP) in SAP ERP:
	MRP show result of MRP calculations
	MRP process creates planned orders to meet dependent requirement
	Stock/requirements List shows:
		Planned orders
		Purchase requisitions (PurRqs)
		Purchase orders (POitems)
	Planner can convert a planned order to a purchase order from Stock/Requirements List by double-clicking the planned order line

	Intergrated system allows Purchasing to make the best decision based on vendor relevant, up-to-date info
	Purchasing employee decides which vendor to use, the order is transmitted to vendor:
		System can be configured to fax order to vendor, transmit it electronically through EDI (electronic data interchange), or send it over the internet

Detailed Scheduling:
	Detailed plan of what to be produced (machine capacity and available vendor)
	One key decision in detailed production scheduling:
		how long to make the production runs for each product
		production run length requires a balance between setup costs and holding costs to minimize total costs
	FS uses repetitive manufacturing
	Repetitive manufacturing environments usually involve production lines that are switched from one product to another similar product:
		production lines are schedule for period of time, rather than for a specific number of items

	Production runs should be decided by evaluating the cost of equipment setup and holding inventory
	Intergrated info simplifies this analysis:
		auto collects accounting info, allow manager to evaluate schedule trade-off interm of costs

Providing Production Data to Accounting:
	ERP packages do not directly connect with production machines (in manufacturing plant)
	Data can be entered into SAP ERP through barcode, PC radio frequency indentification (RFID) or mobile device
	With ERP, accoutning impact of material transaction can be recorded automatically

	Once FS accept shipment, Receiving must notify SAP ERP system of the arrival and acceptance of material (good receipt transaction)
	Receiving department must match goods receipt with pruchase order that initiated it
	When receipt is successfully recorded, SAP ERP immediately records the increase in inventory levels of materials
	
ERP and Suppliers:
	FS is part of supply chain
		starts with farmers growing oats and wheat
		ends with customer buying from retail store
	ERP can play key role in collaborative planning
	Working with suppliers in a collaborative fashion requires trust among parties:
		company opens it records to suppliers
		suppliers can read data (because of common data)
	Advantages:
		reductions in paperwork
		saving in time
		other efficiency improvements
	
Traditional Supply Chain:
	Supply chain: all activities occur between the growing or mining of raw material and the appearance of finshed products on the store shelf
	Traditional supply chain:
		information is passed through the supply chain reactively as participants increate their orders
		inherent time lags cause problems

	EDI and ERP:
		before ERP, they uses electronic data interchange (EDI)
		ERP can facilitate SCM: needed production planning and purchasing systems already in place
		with ERP, sharing produciton plans along the supply chain can ocur in real time

The Measures of Success:
	Performance measurements:
		Metrics
		Show the effects of better supply chain management
	Cash-to-cash cycle time:
		time between paying raw materials and collecting cash
	SCM costs:
		include cost of buying and handling inventory, processing orders and information system support
	Initial fill rate:
		percentage of the order that the suppliers provided in the first shipment
	Initial order lead time:
		time needed for the supplier to fill the order
	On-time performance:
		if suppliers agreed to requested delivery dates, tracks how often supplier actually met those dates
